            </div>
            <div>BMI is a simple and convenient rule of thumb that is used to broadly categorize a person
                as being underweight, normal weight, over weight or obese. A regular use of the BMI is to
                assess how far someones body weight differs from what is normal for an individuals height.
                Below is a table showing the different levels of BMI.

                <label>Your Body Fat Percentage is: <span id="bodyfat"></span>%</label>
            </div>
            <div>Body fat percentage is a measure of fitness level, since it is the only body measurement
                which directly calculates a persons relative body composition without regard to height or weight.
                This calculation is based on gender, BMI and age.

                <label>Your Ideal Weight is: <span id="idealweight"></span> lbs.</label>
            </div>
            <div>Ideal Weight is based on height, gender, and age. There are several popular formulas for calculating
                ideal weight. It is intended to be used as a general guideline along with other useful personal health information.

            </div>
            <div>Knowing your BMR helps you determine the estimated baseline amount of
                calories your body needs to function and serves as a starting point to determine how many calories
                you may want to consume based on your goals.</div>
