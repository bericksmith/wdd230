            <p>ESPN does a nice job with repetition.  As you scroll their pages they use a lot of repeated elements on their pages and share them from page to page.  The video highligts on the page show good repetition as you scroll through to find interesting clips.  Thet also have sections that have a running list of current article that can be read that demonstrate repetition.  And then finally the use of repetition for their score board.  An element that pulls scores from all of the days sporting events and loops through to display each of them and to also update upon reffresh of the page.</p>

            <p>The Church of Jesus Christ really strives to keep their site clean and cluter free.  The site leaves the impression of being very organized.  Titles, text and links have great spacing and padding.  Browsing the page is easy on the eyes and easier to navigate because of the white space that has been implemented.  I think this helps the page to scale better and feel more natural in it's responsive design on phones and tablets.</p>

            <p>The amazon home page does a nice job with proximity.  They are great at organizing the different elements of their page.  Being a site that deals with such a large and diverse selection of products it is easy to get distracted, but they do good to compartmentalize the different elements. Organizing things that were previously purchased, things that you recently looked at, top deals etc.  Making the shopping experience for efficiant</p>
